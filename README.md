## TODO Task 1

Rework quantization model

Work into Tensorboard

Clean dir up.

Add in flask usage? Argue this is a way to deploy all of them?

## Task 2

Add Gru (ws_code)

LSTM from torch

RNN from torch

Any other methods as well could try Gru in torch?

Quantisation for above?

Can I deploy w/ flask?
